## A Budget-Oriented Ortholinear Keyboard

Revision 0 - I do not reccomend making this at the moment, it is more expensive and time consuming to build then it needs to be

Revision 1 **(In Progress)** - Fixes the flaws of Revision 0 and will improve the design for easier construction (possibly add PCB mount stabilizers)

Revision 2 **(Not Final)** - Add an acrylic window on the left and orings for better vibration isolation

## Features
- Rotary Encoder
- Hot Swappable switches
- QMK and VIA support (Not upstream)
- Easy Assembly (Can be made entirely through hole)
- Budget Oriented
- Compatible with a variety of Microcontrollers
